Coderbyte-Solutions
===================

After finishing all of Coderbyte's easy and medium challenges, I thought it might be useful for both myself (and anyone else learning javascript by completing these challenges) to go back through each challenge with cleaner code. Note that this repo is aimed at allowing novice programmers the ability to follow along and are by no means the most optimized/best solutions.
